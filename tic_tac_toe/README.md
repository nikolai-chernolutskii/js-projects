# Tic Tac Toe
_A fancy little project I was doing as part of a FrontEnd Masters course "JavaScript -  From First Steps to Professional" by [Anjana Vakil](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/anjana-vakil/). There isn't currently a lot to show, the main fun is in the console, I just felt like saving the JS code I had come up with during the course to return to it later and develop the logic to make it a complete simple game_.
